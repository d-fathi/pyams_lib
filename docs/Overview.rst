Overview
========

**Python Library for Analog and Mixed Signals (pyams_lib)** aims to simplify the modeling of analog components and circuit simulations using the Python language. It enables users to describe circuit designs and perform simulations utilizing various libraries, packages, and commands.

**pyams_lib** is an open-source tool released under the **GNU** license, providing the following analysis capabilities:

- **DC Analysis:** Steady-state operating point analysis.
- **Time-Domain Analysis:** Simulation of signal behavior over time.
- **Frequency-Domain Analysis:** (Planned for future releases)

The circuit simulation in **pyams_lib** allows for detailed operational analysis, capturing output signals at different operating points. These signals are displayed using a dedicated waveform viewer (matplotlib).

Additionally, **pyams_lib** facilitates behavioral modeling of analog components, with various test circuit simulation results available on the official webpage.
