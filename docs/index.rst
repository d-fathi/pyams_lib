********************
What is `pyams.lib`?
********************

`pyams.lib` is a Python package designed to simplify the modeling of analog and digital elements and the simulation of electronic circuits. It provides:

- The ability to create custom models of electrical components.
- Simulation of circuits in different modes of operation.
- Visualization of simulation results using `matplotlib`.
- Compatibility with Python 3+ and PyPy, working across Linux, Windows, and macOS.
- pip install pyams.lib: `<https://pypi.org/project/pyams.lib/>`_
- PyAMS library (pyams.lib) documentation : `<https://pyams-lib.readthedocs.io/>`_
- github project: `<https://github.com/d-fathi/pyams_lib/>`_
