Gate
=====
This package contains digital gate components of PyAMS libraray.
These components are used to create digital circuits and perform logical operations.
Digital gates are the basic building blocks of digital circuits. They perform logical operations on binary inputs to produce binary outputs. The output of a digital gate is determined by the current input values, and they are used in various applications, including arithmetic operations, data routing, and control logic. Digital gates are essential for implementing complex digital systems such as microprocessors, memory units, and digital signal processors.
Examples of digital gates include AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR gates. These gates can be combined to create more complex circuits such as adders, multiplexers, and flip-flops.
