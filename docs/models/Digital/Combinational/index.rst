.. _Combinational Logic Circuits:

Combinational 
===============
Combinational logic circuits are the basic building blocks of digital systems.
They are used to perform logical operations on binary inputs to produce binary outputs. 
The output of a combinational circuit is determined solely by the current input values, 
without any memory or feedback elements.
Combinational logic circuits are used in various applications, 
including arithmetic operations, data routing, and control logic. 
They are essential for implementing complex digital systems such as microprocessors, 
memory units, and digital signal processors.
Examples of combinational logic circuits include:
helf adders, full adders, multiplexers, demultiplexers, encoders, decoders, and comparators.
