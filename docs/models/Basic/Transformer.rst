Transformer
===========

:red:`Information`
  
A **transformer** is a passive electrical device that transfers electrical energy between circuits through **mutual inductance**. It consists of a **primary coil** and a **secondary coil** with inductance values **Lp** and **Ls**, respectively. The **mutual inductance (M)** couples the two windings.

The relationship between **voltage (V)** and **current (I)** in a transformer follows these equations:

.. math::

    V_p = L_p \cdot \frac{dI_p}{dt} + M \cdot \frac{dI_s}{dt}

    V_s = L_s \cdot \frac{dI_s}{dt} + M \cdot \frac{dI_p}{dt}

Where:

- $V_p$, $V_s$: Primary and secondary voltage (Volts)  
- $I_p$, $I_s$: Primary and secondary current (Amperes)  
- $L_p$, $L_s$: Primary and secondary inductance (Henries)  
- $M$: Mutual inductance (Henries)  

Transformers are widely used for **voltage conversion**, **isolation**, and **impedance matching** in electrical circuits.

:red:`Ports`

- **p1, n1**: Primary coil terminals  
- **p2, n2**: Secondary coil terminals  

:red:`Model`

The **Transformer model** implements a **mutual inductor** with primary and secondary windings.

    The current and voltage relationships are defined based on mutual inductance 
    and time-dependent behavior of inductors.

    Attributes:

       *  Vp (signal): Primary voltage, defined between nodes (p1, n1).  
       *  Ip (signal): Primary current, defined between nodes (p1, n1).  
       *  Vs (signal): Secondary voltage, defined between nodes (p2, n2).  
       *  Is (signal): Secondary current, defined between nodes (p2, n2).  
       *  Lp (param): Primary inductance in Henrys (H), default is **1.0 H**.  
       *  Ls (param): Secondary inductance in Henrys (H), default is **1.0 H**.  
       *  M (param): Mutual inductance in Henrys (H), default is **0.5 H**.  

    Methods:

        analog(): Defines the mutual inductance relationship:

.. math::  

    V_p = L_p \cdot \frac{dI_p}{dt} + M \cdot \frac{dI_s}{dt}

    V_s = L_s \cdot \frac{dI_s}{dt} + M \cdot \frac{dI_p}{dt}

:red:`Command syntax`

The **syntax** for defining a Transformer in a PyAMS simulation:

.. code-block:: python

    # Import the model
    from models import Transformer

    # Tname: is the name of the Transformer instance
    # p1, n1: Primary winding connections
    # p2, n2: Secondary winding connections
    Tname = Transformer(p1, n1, p2, n2)
