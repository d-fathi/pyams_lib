Voltage Logic Level (Input/Output)
==================================

.. role:: red

:red:`Information`

Logic Level at the input of the Gate is known as **Input Logic Level** and corresponding  voltage range as:

* **Logic 1:** Start from $V_{IH}$ (Minimum Input Voltage for Logic High) and Ends at $V_{DD}$.
* **Logic 0:** Start from $V_{SS}$ and Ends at $V_{IL}$ (Maximum Input Voltage for Logic Low).

Logic Level at the output of the Gate is known as **Output Logic Level** and corresponding voltage range as:

* **Logic 1:** Start from $V_{OH}$ (Minimum Output Voltage for Logic High) and Ends at $V_{DD}$.
* **Logic 0:** Start from $V_{SS}$ and Ends at $V_{OL}$ (Maximum Output Voltage for Logic Low).

Below Figure, Explains that.
